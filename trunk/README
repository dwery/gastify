 gastify is a simple notification client for the asterisk plugin app_notify.
 It sits in background and notifies you about an incoming call and displays
 number and name of the caller with a simple popup.
 
 Features: 	* call notification
 		* call history

 gastify is loosely hacked up with the help of http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/407,
 http://systhread.net/texts/200506cdaemon1.php, liferea sourcecode and the sampleClient of the app_notify author
 this is my first c app. but i will try to produce a good code. any suggestions and bugreports are welcome.
